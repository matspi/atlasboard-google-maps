A widget for displaying the fastest route between two points on google-maps.

In order to get it working, you have to get a Google Maps API key (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and add it to your globalAuth.json like this:

{
  "google-apis": {
        "maps" : <key in quotes here>
    }
}
